                <h2>Introduction to Giethoorn</h2>
                
                <p>Giethoorn is a true fairytale come to life. Located in the province of Overijssel in the eastern Netherlands, this idyllic village is known for its extensive canal system, abundant greenery, and distinctive thatched-roof farmhouses. The name "Giethoorn" is believed to have originated from "Geytenhorn" (goat horn), referring to the horns of wild goats that were discovered in the area after a flood in the 10th century.</p>
                
                <p>What makes Giethoorn truly special is its car-free center. The village was established in the 13th century by peat harvesters, who dug out numerous lakes and ponds, leaving the areas in between as islands connected by small bridges. Today, these waterways serve as the main transportation routes, with locals and visitors alike navigating the village by boat, foot, or bicycle.</p>
